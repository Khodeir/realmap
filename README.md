# realmap
A realestate exploration tool.

## Development

You need node and npm installed. (see https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814)

This project uses bower as a package/requirements manager, and grunt for dev task automation.

So once you have npm installed, install these dev dependencies (see package.json for the full list):

    $ cd realmap
    $ npm install

Then, finally install the project dependencies:

    $ bower install

Then you should be good, so start the dev server.

    $ grunt serve
